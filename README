CLS - VT100 CLEAR SCREEN FOR CP/M

This does exactly what it says - it's a CP/M program to clear the screen using the VT100 escape code to do so.
Won't work for other terminal types but I may write other versions of this in the future to support them.

This program was infuenced by cls-cpm by Xander Soldaat, found at this link:

https://github.com/botbench/cls-cpm

His implementation is in C, mine is in Z80 assembly language but will also run on an 8080.
Both programs do exactly the same thing - run it and the screen is cleared, trivial but useful.

I have assembled this using the Pasmo Z80 cross-assembler under Linux like so:

pasmo cls.z80 CLS.COM

...and also using Z80ASM by SLR Systems under CP/M 2.2 on my Cromemco Z-1 computer like so:

z80asm cls

You may have to translate the line endings of the source depending on which operating system you use. A minor
pain in the arse.

**** FILES ****

cls.z80 - the Z80 assembly language source, if you want to assemble it yourself
CLS.COM - the CP/M binary if you can't be bothered assembling it
README - this file you're reading

**** SOFTWARE LICENCE ****

You're kidding, right? This is a trivial program that took a few minutes to whip up. It's taken me more time to
write this README file and upload it to GitHub than it did to create the actual program itself.

You're expecting a licence?! No, there is no licence!

Consider this source and resulting binary public domain. Anybody with basic Z80 programming skills who skimmed
through the first few chapters of an old CP/M programming book could've written this. Funnily enough, that is
exactly how this came about. I'm not even putting my name in the source. Do what ever you want with it. You
can even pretend you wrote it.
